WHAT IS XAL?
============

xal is a small glyph generating utility that allows you
press (KeyPress) and hold a modifier key like Alt_R and
then listen to all the alphanumerical keys are being pressed.
And after you let go (KeyRelease) of the modififier key
that is: Alt_R all the alphanumerical keys that were
pressed when Alt_R was pressed to when Alt_R was released,
will be prefixed with an \u.

USING XCLIP
===========

Here are some ideas for things you can do with xal:

    Listen for only one session and exit:
    $ xal # some keys will be pressed
    \u2550

    Continuously listen for Modifiers:
    $ while :; do xal; done
    \u2550
    \u2551
    \u3422

    $ Render the symbols:
    $ while :; do echo $(xal); done # render the above codes
    ═
    ║
    㐢

    Copy using xclip and press ctrl+v/ctrl+shift+v with xdotool:
    $ echo $(xal) | xclip -selection c && xdotool key ctrl+shift+v
    
    Delete trailing newline:
    $ echo $(xal) | tr -d '\n' | xclip -selection c && xdotool key ctrl+shift+v


HOW CAN I HELP?
===============
xal is somewhat complete. But if you face any issues and have a fix, do
send a pull request. Additionally:
* I need help writing a man page.
* If you found any non-alphanumeric keys that weren't blacklisted then let me know.
* If you want to make this have arguments then let me know.
* Any more feature ideas?
